# blocks-world-redux
The project I was working on under Prof. Sass from architectural department when I went to MIT during Fall 2014

Some of the technical challenges I overcame:
•	Color distinction in RGB values for all the shapes.
•	Shape distinction with self-correlation of areas.
•	Make the robot understand the shape correctly in spite of perspective changes.
•	To find the centroid of the shape.
• To find the vertices of the shapes if not elliptical in nature.
•	Avoid discontinuous edges and holes.
•	Moving the arm with PWM signals applied to the Servos synchronously with precision.
•	Cancel noise due to the CMOS sensor.
•	Check for corrections after each step is completed through a feedback loop.
•	Connecting to the robot controller through network with KCT toolbox.
•	Knowing the processor which is going to be used
